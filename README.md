# fips json
FIPS codes in JSON format. Nothing else.

## Where is it from?

Data was taken from here: [USDA](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697)

## Why does this exist?

Every other file I could find had GeoJSON features in it, which is great -- don't get me wrong. But, I just needed something to look up a FIPS code to a county *without* everything extra.
